// Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`.
// You can put the expression for the second element where ??? is so that the test passes.
// Execute `rustlings hint primitive_types6` for hints!

// Hint
//
// While you could use a destructuring `let` for the tuple here, try
// indexing into it instead, as explained in the last example of the
// Data Types -> The Tuple Type section of the book:
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type
// Now you have another tool in your toolbox!


#[test]
fn indexing_tuple() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3);
    // Replace below ??? with the tuple indexing syntax.
    let second = numbers.1;

    assert_eq!(2, second,
        "This is not the 2nd number in the tuple!")
}
