// structs3.rs
// Structs contain data, but can also have logic. In this exercise we have
// defined the Package struct and we want to test some logic attached to it.
// Make the code compile and the tests pass!
// If you have issues execute `rustlings hint structs3`

// Hint
//
// The new method needs to panic if the weight is physically impossible :), how do we do that in Rust?
//
// For is_international: What makes a package international? Seems related to the places it goes through right?
//
// For calculate_transport_fees: Bigger is more expensive usually, we don't have size, but something may fit the bill here :)
//
// Have a look in The Book, to find out more about method implementations: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html
