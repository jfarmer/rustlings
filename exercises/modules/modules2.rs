// You can bring module paths into scopes and provide new names for them with the
// 'use' and 'as' keywords. Fix these 'use' statements to make the code compile.
// Make me compile! Execute `rustlings hint modules2` for hints :)

// Hint
//
// The delicious_snacks module is trying to present an external interface that is
// different than its internal structure (the `fruits` and `veggies` modules and
// associated constants). Complete the `use` statemants to fit the uses in main and
// find the one keyword missing for both constants.
